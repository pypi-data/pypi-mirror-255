## Overview

**Generate iCalendar with your [Strava][] activities**

Uses [strava-offline][] to keep and incrementally sync with a local database of activities.

![Example screenshot of the output in Google Calendar](https://github.com/liskin/strava-ical/assets/300342/71d2e9c5-f9ef-481c-b5ee-4a71fd09caa4)

[strava-offline]: https://github.com/liskin/strava-offline#readme
[Strava]: https://strava.com/

## Installation

Using [pipx][]:

```
pipx ensurepath
pipx install "strava-ical[strava]"
```

To keep a local git clone around:

```
git clone https://github.com/liskin/strava-ical
make -C strava-ical pipx
```

Alternatively, if you don't need the isolated virtualenv that [pipx][]
provides, feel free to just:

```
pip install "strava-ical[strava]"
```

If you've already installed [strava-offline][] and use it separately, you can
omit the `[strava]` bit to avoid installing strava-offline twice.

[pipx]: https://github.com/pypa/pipx

## Setup and usage

* Run `strava-ical-sync` (or `strava-offline sqlite` if you chose to install
  [strava-offline][] separately) to synchronize activities metadata to a local
  sqlite database. This takes a while: first time a couple dozen seconds, then
  it syncs incrementally which only takes a few seconds each time. Add `-v` to
  see progress.

  The first time you do this, it will open Strava in a browser and ask for
  permissions. Should you run into any trouble at this point, consult
  [strava-offline][] readme or open an issue.

  If you make changes to older activities (to assign a different bike to a
  ride, for example), you may need a `--full` re-sync rathen than the default
  incremental one. See the [note about incremental synchronization](https://github.com/liskin/strava-offline#note-about-incremental-synchronization)
  for a detailed explanation.

* Run `strava-ical`:

  ```
  $ strava-ical --max-size 1M -o strava-activities.ical
  ```

* Import `strava-activities.ical` into your calendar app of choice.

  (Note that Google Calendar refreshes iCal URLs once a day and cannot be
  tweaked in any way. Manual refresh isn't possible either.)
