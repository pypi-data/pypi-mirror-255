Instruction Reference
=====================
These tables provide summaries for the baseline RISC-V instructions and common extensions.
Full `specifications <https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/>`_ be found on the RISC-V website.
Additionally, more details about each instruction can be found `here <https://msyksphinz-self.github.io/riscv-isadoc/html/index.html>`_.

Pseudo Instructions
-------------------
These pseudo-instructions represent additional actions and can be used like regular instructions.
One of the early passes in the assembler will transform them as described in this table.

All of the following atomic instructions also accept two additional parameters: :code:`aq` and :code:`rl`.
These are short for "acquire" and "release" and must either be both specified or both unspecified.
The default for each if unspecified is zero.

For example::

  # both aq and rl are zero
  lr.w t0 t1
  lr.w t0 t1 0 0

  # both aq and rl are one
  lr.w t0 t1 1 1

  # mix and match
  lr.w t0 t1 0 1  # aq=0, rl=1
  lr.w t0 t1 1 0  # aq=1, rl=0
