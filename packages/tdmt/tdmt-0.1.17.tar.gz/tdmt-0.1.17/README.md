# Tabular Data Management Tool (tdmt)

## Basics

The Tabular Data Management Tool (tdmt) is a command line Python app that uses a spreadsheet that allows the user to specify how to process tabular data.

When there is a need to perform multiple operations on several files, the advantage of a tabular method compared to processing data directly in Python is that the processing steps are clearly visible. This makes it easy to follow what was done to which file, and which files were combined in what ways, and in what order.
