# jctl

## Introduction

`jctl` is a command line tool that performs CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations on a [Jamf Pro or Jamf Cloud](https://www.jamf.com/) server. It can automate repetitive tasks and provide options not available in the web GUI. It uses and is the primary driver of [`python-jamf`](https://github.com/univ-of-utah-marriott-library-apple/python-jamf), which is a Python 3 module for the [Jamf Pro Classic API](https://www.jamf.com/resources/videos/an-introduction-to-the-classic-api/). 

There are a few other tools that are part of this project. `pkgctl` is automates various operations with packages, such as promotion and creating patch definitions. `patch.py` is a deprecated script designed to automate the patching process. It is still part of the project because it can do a few things that `jctl` can't. However, it is not being tested. `update_asset_tags.py` was demoed at the 2021 JNUC presentation [_Turn 1000 clicks into 1 with python-jamf and jctl_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YLriNwyP3s). We decided to include it here. It is not being tested either.

`jctl` only supports 56 Jamf Pro record types. `python-jamf` can access all record types.  `python-jamf` stores the Jamf Pro credentials in the keychain using [keyring](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) (instead of cleartext, like all other Jamf API projects that we know of).

## Quick Start

If you don't have Python installed, you need to read about [Installing Python](https://github.com/univ-of-utah-marriott-library-apple/jctl/wiki/Installing-Python) on the wiki.

### Installing

- Install Module & Requirements: `sudo pip3 install jctl`
- On your Jamf Pro server create a Jamf Pro API User
- Config: `conf-python-jamf`
- Enter hostname, username, and password
- Test: `conf-python-jamf -t`
