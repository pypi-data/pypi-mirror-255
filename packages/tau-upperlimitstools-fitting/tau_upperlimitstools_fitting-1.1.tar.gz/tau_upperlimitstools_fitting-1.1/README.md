# tau_UpperLimitsTools_fitting

"""
A small (package) collection of examples to obtain fits and upper limits for cLFV.  

Tau_upperlimitstools_fitting based on ROOT.

Essential tools used by the tau group at Belle II experiment.

"""

- Description 

The module facilitates the creation/configuration of the S+B extended model.

Functions for calculating upper limits on model parameters using both asymptotic and toy-based methods are included.

 The module also provides utilities for printing and saving results, as well as generating Brazil band plots to visualize confidence intervals.

Each function is documented with informative docstrings (AI assistance), offering a guide on their usage.
