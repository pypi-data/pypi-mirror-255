# ramps
```
This is an empty module intented as a placeholder
for use for offline modules.

This module is meant as a way of reserving
the name "ramps" for everyone's use in non pypi 
or otherwise python3 enterprizes. 

There are zero plans to use this name
for any purpose besides giving everyone
a module name for use in non pypi enterprizes.

This claim should prevent accidental 
publishing to pypi and ensure that no 
disrespect to other calculator builders
occurs by using the same name for one 
of your non pypi enterprizes as the name of 
an actual pypi enterprize.
