## üåüOverview

EasyInstruct is a Python package which is proposed as an easy-to-use instruction processing framework for Large Language Models(LLMs) like GPT-4, LLaMA, ChatGLM in your research experiments. EasyInstruct modularizes instruction generation, selection, and prompting, while also considering their combination and interaction. 

<img src="figs/overview.png">

- The current supported instruction generation techniques are as follows:

  | **Methods** | **Description** |
  | --- | --- |
  | [Self-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560) | The method that randomly samples a few instructions from a human-annotated seed tasks pool as demonstrations and prompts an LLM to generate more instructions and corresponding input-output pairs. |
  | [Evol-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244) | The method that incrementally upgrades an initial set of instructions into more complex instructions by prompting an LLM with specific prompts. |
  | [Backtranslation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06259) | The method that creates an instruction following training instance by predicting an instruction that would be correctly answered by a portion of a document of the corpus.  |
  | [KG2Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11527) | The method that creates an instruction following training instance by predicting an instruction that would be correctly answered by a portion of a document of the corpus. |

## ‚è©Quickstart

We provide two ways for users to quickly get started with EasyInstruct. You can either use the shell script or the Gradio app based on your specific needs.

### Shell Script

#### Step1: Prepare a configuration file

Users can easily configure the parameters of EasyInstruct in a YAML-style file or just quickly use the default parameters in the configuration files we provide. Following is an example of the configuration file for Self-Instruct:

```yaml
generator:
  SelfInstructGenerator:
    target_dir: data/generations/
    data_format: alpaca
    seed_tasks_path: data/seed_tasks.jsonl
    generated_instructions_path: generated_instructions.jsonl
    generated_instances_path: generated_instances.jsonl
    num_instructions_to_generate: 100
    engine: gpt-3.5-turbo
    num_prompt_instructions: 8
```

More example configuration files can be found at [configs](https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyInstruct/tree/main/configs).

#### Step2: Run the shell script

Users should first specify the configuration file and provide their own OpenAI API key. Then, run the following shell script to launch the instruction generation or selection process.

```shell
config_file=""
openai_api_key=""

python demo/run.py \
    --config  $config_file\
    --openai_api_key $openai_api_key \
```

### Gradio App

We provide a Gradio app for users to quickly get started with EasyInstruct. You can run the following command to launch the Gradio app locally on the port `7860` (if available).

```shell
python demo/app.py
```

We also host a running gradio app in HuggingFace Spaces. You can try it out [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zjunlp/EasyInstruct).

Please refer to our [documentations](https://zjunlp.gitbook.io/easyinstruct/documentations) for more details.

### Generators

The `Generators` module streamlines the process of instruction data generation, allowing for the generation of instruction data based on seed data. You can choose the appropriate generator based on your specific needs.

#### BaseGenerator

> `BaseGenerator` is the base class for all generators.

> You can also easily inherit this base class to customize your own generator class. Just override the `__init__` and `generate` method.

#### SelfInstructGenerator

> `SelfInstructGenerator` is the class for the instruction generation method of Self-Instruct. See [Self-Instruct: Aligning Language Model with Self Generated Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560) for more details.

<b>Example</b>

```python
from easyinstruct import SelfInstructGenerator
from easyinstruct.utils.api import set_openai_key

# Step1: Set your own API-KEY
set_openai_key("YOUR-KEY")

# Step2: Declare a generator class
generator = SelfInstructGenerator(num_instructions_to_generate=10)

# Step3: Generate self-instruct data
generator.generate()
```

#### BacktranslationGenerator

> `BacktranslationGenerator` is the class for the instruction generation method of Instruction Backtranslation. See [Self-Alignment with Instruction Backtranslation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06259) for more details.

<details>
<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

```python
from easyinstruct import BacktranslationGenerator
from easyinstruct.utils.api import set_openai_key

# Step1: Set your own API-KEY
set_openai_key("YOUR-KEY")

# Step2: Declare a generator class
generator = BacktranslationGenerator(num_instructions_to_generate=10)

# Step3: Generate backtranslation data
generator.generate()
```

#### GPTScoreSelector

> `GPTScoreSelector` is the class for selecting instruction samples based on the GPT score, which reflects whether the output is a good example of how AI Assistant should respond to the user's instruction, provided by ChatGPT.

#### PPLSelector

> `PPLSelector` is the class for selecting instruction samples based on the perplexity, which is the exponentiated average negative log-likelihood of response.

#### MTLDSelector

> `MTLDSelector` is the class for selecting instruction samples based on the MTLD, which is short for Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity.

#### CodeSelector

> `CodeSelector` is the class for selecting code instruction samples based on the Complexity-Impacted Reasoning Score (CIRS), which combines structural and logical attributes, to measure the correlation between code and reasoning abilities. See [When Do Program-of-Thoughts Work for Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15452) for more details.

<details>
<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

```python
from easyinstruct import CodeSelector

# Step1: Specify your source file of code instructions
src_file = "data/code_example.json"

# Step2: Declare a code selecter class
selector = CodeSelector(
    source_file_path=src_file, 
    target_dir="data/selections/",
    manually_partion_data=True,
    min_boundary = 0.125,
    max_boundary = 0.5,
    automatically_partion_data = True,
    k_means_cluster_number = 2,
    )

# Step3: Process the code instructions
selector.process()
```

</details>

#### MultiSelector

> `MultiSelector` is the class for combining multiple appropricate selectors based on your specific needs.

### Prompts

The `Prompts` module standardizes the instruction prompting step, where user requests are constructed as instruction prompts and sent to specific LLMs to obtain responses. You can choose the appropriate prompting method based on your specific needs.
