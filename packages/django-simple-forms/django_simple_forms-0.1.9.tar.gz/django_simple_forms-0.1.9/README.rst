===================
django-simple-forms
===================

The django-simple-forms Django app is in an early stage of development and looking for contributors. Priorities are completing tests and documentation. Use at your own risk.

This app is used to build and manage Django forms in the admin without having to write code. Form responses can be viewed or edited in the admin, and reponses can be emailed to any number of recipients our output as PDFs with custom templates. Responses can be downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet.

-----------
Quick start
-----------

1. Run ``pip install django-simple-forms``.

2. Add django-simple-forms and its dependencies to your installed apps: ::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django.contrib.sites',

        'adminsortable2',
        'ckeditor',
        'django_simple_file_handler',
        'django_simple_forms',
    )

3. Run ``python manage.py migrate``.

4. Include the django-simple-forms URLconf and the django-simple-file-handler URLconf in your website's ``urls.py``: ::

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        path(
            'forms/',
            include('django_simple_forms.urls')
        ),
        path(
            'pdf/',
            include('django_simple_file_handler.urls'),
        ),
    ]

5. If you are already using the Django sites framework, run ``python manage.py forms_import_sites``.
You will then need to go to FORMS > Site profiles in your admin site and check to be sure your details are correct.
All new site profiles will be assigned an ``https://`` protocol, so change this if necessary.

If you are not already using the Django sites framework, go to your admin site and, under FORMS > Site profiles, create a profile with your site's information.

The ``SITE_ID`` setting is needed for django-simple-forms. See the `Django sites framework documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/sites/>`_ for more information.

6. Refer to the `Django email documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/email/>`_ for information on configuring a website to send email.

7. If you intend to use PDF output, see the ``Generating PDFs`` section of the `django-simple-file-handler documentation <https://github.com/jonathanrickard/django-simple-file-handler>`_ for additional configuration information.
