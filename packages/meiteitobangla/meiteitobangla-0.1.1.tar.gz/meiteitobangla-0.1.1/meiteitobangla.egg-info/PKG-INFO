# MeiteiToBangla
This Python module was created to facilitate the conversion of Manipuri Language (`mni`) from Meitei Mayek script to Bengali script. The module is based on the Unicode standard for Meitei Mayek script and the Unicode standard for Bengali script. The module is designed to be used with Python 3.6 or later.
I kindly thank the following people for their help in creating this module:
1. [Haoreima](https://mni.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Haoreima) for the Meitei Mayek to Bangla rules and the Meitei Mayek Unicode standard.
# Background
Meitei Mayek is the script used to write the Meitei language, which is spoken in the Indian state of Manipur. The script is based on the Bengali script, and the two scripts share many characters. However, there are some differences between the two scripts, and the Meitei Mayek script has some characters that are not present in the Bengali script.
