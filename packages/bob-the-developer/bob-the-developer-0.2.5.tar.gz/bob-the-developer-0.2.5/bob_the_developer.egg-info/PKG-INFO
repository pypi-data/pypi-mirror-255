Bob is my collection of build tools. The goal is to provide a simple interface
to build and test projects without having to remember or lookup various commands.

For now, this project limits itself to C/C++ projects.

How to use
==========

.. code-block:: bash

  bob build

Other commands available are:
* `bootstrap`: gather dependencies and toolchain(s)
* `configure`: configure a build system.
* `install`: install the package.

Requirements
============

 * Python 3.8+
 * git

Development
===========

1. Setup a virtual environment and activate it:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m venv .env_dev
   . .env_dev/bin/activate

2. Install locally:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --editable .[dev]

3. Test:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest


Run the complete test-suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Setup a virtual environment and activate it:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m venv .env_tox
   . .env_tox/bin/activate

2. Install locally:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --editable .[tox]

3. Test:
