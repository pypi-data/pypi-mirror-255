    A : SciPy sparse array
       Graph adjacency matrix.

    Notes
    -----
    For directed graphs, matrix entry i,j corresponds to an edge from i to j.

    The matrix entries are populated using the edge attribute held in
    parameter weight. When an edge does not have that attribute, the
    value of the entry is 1.

    For multiple edges the matrix values are the sums of the edge weights.

    When `nodelist` does not contain every node in `G`, the adjacency matrix
    is built from the subgraph of `G` that is induced by the nodes in
    `nodelist`.

    The convention used for self-loop edges in graphs is to assign the
    diagonal matrix entry value to the weight attribute of the edge
    (or the number 1 if the edge has no weight attribute).  If the
    alternate convention of doubling the edge weight is desired the
    resulting Scipy sparse matrix can be modified as follows:

    # instead of zero, for two reasons:
    #
    #   1) It can be important to distinguish a real edge with the value 0
    #      from a nonedge with the value 0.
    #
    #   2) When working with multi(di)graphs, we must combine the values of all
    #      edges between any two nodes in some manner.  This often takes the
    #      form of a sum, min, or max.  Using the value 0 for a nonedge would
    #      have undesirable effects with min and max, but using nanmin and
    #      nanmax with initially nan values is not problematic at all.
    #
    # That said, there are still some drawbacks to this approach. Namely, if
    # a real edge is nan, then that value is a) not distinguishable from
    # nonedges and b) is ignored by the default combinator (nansum, nanmin,
    # nanmax) functions used for multi(di)graphs. If this becomes an issue,
    # an alternative approach is to use masked arrays.  Initially, every
    # element is masked and set to some `initial` value. As we populate the
    # graph, elements are unmasked (automatically) when we combine the initial
    # value with the values given by real edges.  At the end, we convert all

    Parameters
    ----------

      An adjacency matrix representation of a graph

    create_using : EasyGraph graph constructor, optional (default=eg.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Notes
    -----
    For directed graphs, explicitly mention create_using=eg.DiGraph,

    If `df` has a single data type for each entry it will be converted to an
    appropriate Python data type.

    If `df` has a user-specified compound data type the names
    of the data fields will be used as attribute keys in the resulting
