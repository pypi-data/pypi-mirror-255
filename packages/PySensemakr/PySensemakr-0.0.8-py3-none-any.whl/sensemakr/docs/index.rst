PySensemakr: Sensitivity Analysis Tools for Regression Models in Python
=======================================

``sensemakr`` for Python (``PySensemakr``) implements a suite of sensitivity analysis tools that makes it easier to understand the impact of omitted variables in linear regression models, as discussed in `Cinelli and Hazlett (2020) <https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssb.12348>`_.

The Python version of the package closely mirrors the R version, which can be found `here <http://carloscinelli.com/sensemakr/>`_.
