Bounds on the strength of unobserved confounders using observed covariates, as in Cinelli and Hazlett (2020).

The main generic function is ovb_bounds, which can compute both the bounds on the strength of confounding
as well as the adjusted estimates, standard errors, t-values and confidence intervals.

Other functions that compute only the bounds on the strength of confounding are also provided. These functions
may be useful when computing benchmarks for using only summary statistics from papers you see in print.

Currently it implements only the bounds based on partial R2. Other bounds will be implemented soon.

Load example dataset

        a string or list of strings with names of the variables to use for benchmark bounding.
    kd : float or list of floats
        a float or list of floats with each being a multiple of the strength of association between a
        benchmark variable and the treatment variable to test with benchmark bounding (Default value = 1).

        a float with the significance level for the robustness value RV_qa to render the
        estimate not significant (Default value = 0.05).

    reduce : boolean
        whether to reduce (True, default) or increase (False) the estimate due to putative confounding.
