## What?

<img width="40%" align="right" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-08 at 13 47 28" src="https://github.com/Textualize/tailless/assets/554369/e4b9e41b-2a42-4cef-b47c-e58a9e4db44a">


- Live tailing of log files.
- Syntax highlights common web server log formats.
- Files don't need to be loaded in to memory, which means it is as fast to open a multiple-gigabyte files as it is to open tiny text file.
- Support for JSONL files: lines are pretty printed.
- Opens .bz and .bz2 files automatically.
- Merges log files by auto detecting timestamps.
  

## Why?

I spent a lot of time in my past life as a web developer working with logs, typically on web servers via ssh.
I would use a variety of tools, but my goto method of analyzing logs was directly on the server with *nix tools like as `tail`, `less`, and `grep` etc.
As useful as these tools are, they are not without friction.

I built `toolong` to be the tool I would have wanted back then.
It is snappy, straightforward to use, and does a lot of the *grunt work* for you.

## How?

Toolong is currently best installed with [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx).

```bash
pipx install toolong
```

You could also install Toolong with Pip:

```bash
pip install toolong
```

> [!NOTE] 
> If you use pip, you should ideally create a virtual environment to avoid potential dependancy conflicts.

However you install Toolong, the `tl` command will be added to your path:

```bash
tl
```

In the near future there will be more install methods, and hopefully your favorite package manager.

### Opening files

To open a file with Toolong, add the file name(s) as arguments to the command:

```bash
tl mylogfile.log
```

If you add multiple filenames, they will open in tabs.

Added the `--merge` switch to open multiple files and combine them in to a single view:

```bash
tl access.log* --merge
```

In the app, press ++f1++ for additional help.

However you install Toolong, the `tl` command will be added to your path.
Run it to test instalation:

```bash

## History

If you [follow me](https://twitter.com/willmcgugan) on Twitter, you may have seen me refer to this app as *Tailless*, because it was intended to be a replacement for a `tail` + `less` combo.
I settled on the name "Toolong" because it is a bit more apt, and still had the same initials.

## Development

Toolong v1.0.0 has a solid feature set, which covers most of my requirements.
However, there is a tonne of features which could be added to something like this, and I will likely implement some of them in the future.

If you want to talk about Toolong, find me on the [Textualize Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr).


## Thanks

I am grateful for the [LogMerger](https://github.com/ptmcg/logmerger) project which I referenced (and borrowed regexes from) when building Toolong.

## Alternatives

Toolong is not the first TUI for working with log files. See [lnav](https://lnav.org/) as a more mature alternative.
