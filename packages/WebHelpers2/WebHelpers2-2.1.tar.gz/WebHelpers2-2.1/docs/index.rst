**WebHelpers2** contains convenience functions and classes to make HTML tags,
process text, format numbers, do basic statistics, work with collections, and
more. It's the successor to WebHelpers_.

**Version 2.1** fixes bugs and adds Python 3 support. The API and features are
unchanged since 2.0. This version works on both Python 3 and 2. It was tested
on Python 3.9, 3,10, 3,11, 3.12, and 2.7 on Linux, and should work on other platforms.

**The next version** will drop Python 2 and older Python 3 versions.
No new helpers or API changes are expected.
Instead it will focus on updating the packaging and documentation.
It may delete some helpers that now have equivalents in recent Python versions.
