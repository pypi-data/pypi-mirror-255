Simple Python library to manage your resources at seaplane.

## What is Seaplane?

Seaplane is the global platform for building and scaling your application stack
without the complexity of managing cloud infrastructure.

It serves as a reference application for how our APIs can be utilized.

Not sure where to go to quickly run a workload on Seaplane? See our [Getting
Started] guide.

To build and test this software yourself, see the CONTRIBUTIONS.md document that is a peer to this one.

## Installation

```shell
pip install seaplane
```

## Configure your API KEY

You can provide your Seaplane API key to the library in a few ways

* Set `SEAPLANE_API_KEY` environment variable.
* Use `config` object in order to set the api key.

```python
from seaplane.config import config

config.set_api_key("your_api_key")
```
