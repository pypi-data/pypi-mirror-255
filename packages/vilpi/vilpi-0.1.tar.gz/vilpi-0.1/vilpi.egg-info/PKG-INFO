# PyTorch Model Visualizer

## Introduction
This library is a Python tool designed to help machine learning practitioners and researchers visualize the architecture of PyTorch models. By representing each layer as a colored block, it offers a clear and intuitive understanding of a model's structure, aiding in analysis and debugging.

## Features
- Visualize PyTorch model layers as colored blocks.
- Customize the maximum number of layers per subplot.
- Easy integration into PyTorch workflows.

## Installation
This tool requires Python and PyTorch, along with Matplotlib for visualization. Ensure these are installed in your environment:
```pip install vilpi```

## Warning
This library is designed for small models, so do not use it for large models.

## Required Libraries for visualisation
pip install matplotlib
