The documentation of the core components of Arasea is still a work in
progress. For now this is a list of bits and pieces on the subject,
some of them might be outdated though:

  introduces the basics concerning Arasea datatypes.

* :ref:`arasea_ctype` -- Tutorial on how to make your type C-friendly.

* :ref:`views_and_inplace` -- This is somewhere between extending Arasea and
  describing how Arasea works internally; it talks about views and inplace
  operations.

* :ref:`pipeline` -- Describes the steps of compiling an Arasea Function.

* :ref:`graphstructures` -- Describes the symbolic graphs generated by
  :mod:`arasea.scan`.

  an Arasea function and print the inputs and outputs of each op.
