Currently most of the examples built by `@Rodrigo <https://github.com/fitoprincipe>`__ are still using the old implementation of the library.
They should be transformed into modern example and moved from the old `notebook <https://github.com/gee-community/geetools/tree/main/notebooks>`__ folder to the new `example <https://github.com/gee-community/geetools/tree/main/docs/example>`__ one to be displayed in our doc.

The examples are regular notebook files that are interpreted by the nbsphinx lib and displayed in the doc, clicking on the :guilabel:`open in colab` button will open a colab notebook with the code ready to be executed and the :guilabel:`view source` will bring you back to github.

To add a new example, you can use the `example template <https://github.com/gee-community/geetools/tree/main/docs/example/template.ipynb>`__ and replace things with your code.

Then you can open a PR with the new file and it will be reviewed and merged.
