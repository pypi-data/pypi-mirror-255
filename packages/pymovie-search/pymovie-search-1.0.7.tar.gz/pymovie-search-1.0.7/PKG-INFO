## Pymovie

PyMovie is a terminal utility program that searches [VidSrc](https://vidsrc.to)'s API to provide movies for free. This exists purely as a proof of concept idea as opposed to a production ready application. 

## Installation

**Automatic**

```
pip install pymovie-search
``` 

> [!NOTE]
> The movie library that the program downloads is simply a json file. Although it might take a while, rest assured that the program is not filling your disk with massive files without your consent. Additionally, the program will report the amount of space that it had used at the end of the download. 

**Manual (Linux/macOS only)**

- Install Python 3
- Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SomedudeX/PyMovie
cd PyMovie
```
- Install required packages
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You could stop here and use the python script as it is by running `python3 App/entrypoint.py`, but if wish to build the project into an executable, follow the steps below:

- Install PyInstaller
```bash
pip3 install pyinstaller
```
- "Build" the project by running
```bash
./setup.sh
```
The output file will then be created in the dist folder. 

## Uninstallation
Use the reset option from within the application (Windows/macOS/Linux) or run `uninstall.sh` (macOS/Linux) to delete all configuration files and caches pertinent to the application. 

## Disclaimer

The author of this project shall, under no circumstance, take liability or responsibility for losses or damages incurred as a result of your use of this application. Your use and reliance on this program is solely at your own risk. This program is for educational purposes only.
