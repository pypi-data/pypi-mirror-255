**********   Changes to version 0.1.11 (0.1.12 - 2024.02.02)  **********
- PaIRS now includes the possibility to customize the windowing parameters for each iteration of a PIV process. The user can choose the windowing parameters for each iteration in the initial phase of the PIV process. This is possible by operating in the Windowing box at the bottom of the Process tab (visible only in the expert mode). A table widget has been added to this section, where the user can find all relevant information the windowing scheme for the PIV process and modify it iteration by iteration. By selecting the corresponding row of the table, the user can choose for the current iteration the type of weighting window to be used in the calculation of the absolute velocity and in the determination of the correlation map, if using the direct correlations or not and the maximum displacement allowed in the interrogation window. The latter parameter is an innovation of the present version itself and adds to the custom settings selectable by the user to build affordable validation strategies. In addition, in the table an indication about the stability of the windowing scheme for each iteration is reported. In conclusion, a larger degree of customization of the PIV process comes with the present modification of PaIRS.
 
- CalVi now fully supports optical camera calibration for transparent cylindrical geometries. In the version 0.1.10 this camera model was available only in debug mode for beta testers and developers, now it is fully working. The calibration of this camera model is however a delicate task and the user is referred to the CalVi guide for reliable experimental procedures that could be used in this direction.

- PaIRS and CalVi now checks for new releases of the PaIRS-UniNa package and if a new version is found online, a notification is shown. The users are warmly recommended to stay up-to-date with the latest issues of PaIRS-UniNa!

Minor changes:
- It is now possible to import previously obtained calibration results in CalVi. This saves considerable time by avoiding the initial phase of search of the control points in the different target images used for the calibration process.

- It is now possible to launch new instances of PaIRS and CalVi from a specific menu in the Menu bar of both the software applications.

- In the Import tab, the previously selected paths are now stored and suggested to the user while typing in the corresponding edit box.

- Minor bugs solved.
