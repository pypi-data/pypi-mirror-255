    "Let $E$ be a space of elementary events. Consider the powerset $2^E$ and le $\\Im \\subset 2^E$ be a set of subsets of $E$. Elements of $\\Im$ are called random events. If $\\Im$ satisfies the following properties,it is called a $\\sigma$-algebra.\n",

Furthermore, for intersecting sets you have to subtract the intersection, because it is added in there twice otherwise. A common way to visually think about those things are venn diagrams. "
