G-ADOPT
=======

This repository contains material and examples relating to the G-ADOPT
Platform, a computational platform for inverse geodynamics, being
developed and maintained by researchers from the Research School of
Earth Sciences at the Australian National University. It builds on a
recent surge in accessible observational datasets and advances in
inversion methods using sophisticated adjoint techniques that provide
a mechanism for fusing these observations with dynamics, physics and
chemistry.

G-ADOPT is supported and funded by the Australian Research Data
Commons (ARDC), with additional partner contributions from AuScope,
the NCI and Geosciences Australia.

Installation
------------

G-ADOPT is available on PyPI as `gadopt`, and requires a working
[Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/) installation. To bring
in the optional nonlinear optimisation dependencies, install the
`gadopt[optimisation]` variant.
