[local]
# The code to use. This may maybe more than just the name of the code, and variables in braces
# {} will be expanded. For example:
#   code = mpiexec -np {NTASKS} lmp_mpi
# would expand {NTASKS} to the number of tasks and run the command
code = mopac

# The type of local installation to use. Options are:
#   conda: Use a conda environment
#   modules: Use the modules system
#   local: Use a local installation
# By default SEAMM installs MOPAC using conda.

# The Conda environment to use. This is the name or full path of the environment to use.

# The modules to load to run MOPAC. This is a list of strings, each of which
# is a module to load. For example, to load the modules mopac and openmpi,
# you would use:
#   modules = mopac openmpi
# modules =

#   code = mpiexec -np {NTASKS} lmp_mpi

# The name and location of the Docker container to use, optionally with the version
