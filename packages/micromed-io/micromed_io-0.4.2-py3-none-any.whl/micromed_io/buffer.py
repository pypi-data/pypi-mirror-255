    Parameters
    ----------
    epoch_duration: float, default=None
        The epoch duration in sec.
    epoch_overlap: float, default=None
        The epoch overlap in sec.

    Attributes
    ----------
    epoch_duration: float
        The epoch duration in sec.
    epoch_overlap: float
        The epoch overlap in sec.
    epoch_buffer: np.ndarray
        The epoch buffer that is filled every new eeg packet received. (see Notes 2.)
    current_buffer_length: int
        The position of the next eeg data to fill. (see Notes 1.)
    current_epoch: np.ndarray
        The last full epoch.

    Notes
    -----
    #. The epoch buffer works this way:

        - each time we receive new data, we fill the buffer with the selected channels (cf ``picks``)
        - we keep the position of the "filled data" in current_buffer_length
        - as soon as an epoch_buffer is full, the array is stored in current_epoch and the new data \
    are filled back from current_buffer_length=0.

    #. Be careful with ``picks`` order as it changes the epoch structure (order from ``picks`` is kept). \
    ``["Fp1-G2", "Fpz-G2", "MKR+-MKR-"]`` doest not give the same epoch buffer as \
    ``["MKR+-MKR-", "Fp1-G2", "Fpz-G2"]``.
