# =====================
# Why Using this Script
# =====================
#
# This script fixes the following error:
#
#    OMP: Error #15: Initializing libomp.dylib, but found libomp.dylib already
#    initialized.
#    OMP: Hint This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been
#    linked into the program. That is dangerous, since it can degrade
#    performance or cause incorrect results. The best thing to do is to ensure
#    that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by
#    avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library. As an
#    unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment
#    variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to
#    execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results.
#    For more information, please see http://openmp.llvm.org/
#    Abort trap: 6
#
# The above error happens only on MacOS. The error is originated because both
# this package (`glearn`) and its dependency package (`imate`) are shipped with
# a version of `libomp` library. Since both of these libraries try to be
# initialized at the runtime, the duplicity leads to a termination error.
#
# To resolve this issue, this script removes the `libomp.dylib` from the
# `imate` package. Also, if `glearn` package comes with `libomp.dylib`, it
# copies it from `glearn` package to `imate` package.
#
# ============================
# How This Script Finds Libomp
# ============================
#
# This script uses two methods to find the libomp.dylib for each package:
#
# 1. In the first method, it searches for site-package/.dylibs/libomp.dylib.
#    This file is usually bundled to the package using "delocate" on the
#    package wheel (usually within cibuildwheel). If the package is installed
#    via pip, this lib should exists in site-package/.dylibs. If it does not
#    exists, it uses the second method below. In this case, we call this
#    library as "bundled libomp".
# 2. In the second method, we go through all "*.so" files inside the package.
#    For each "*.so" file, we execute "otool -L file.so", which returns the
#    list of all shared libraries that is linked to this *.so file. Then we
#    grep for libomp.dylib. In the second method, this library is usually
#    installed somewhere on the system (like /usr/local/Cellar/opt/libomp/).
#    The second method usually occurs when the package is compiled locally and
#    not installed via wheel. Hence, it is linked to a libomp that is on the
#    system (not bundled to the package). In this case, we call this linrary
#    as "system library".
#
# ================================================
# How One Libomp is Replaced With The Other Libomp
# ================================================
#
# For both imate and glearn packages, we search of libomp. First, we check for
# bundled lib, if not found, we search for system library.
#
# If both imate and glearn found to have bundled libomp, the we replace the lib
# for glearn with the one for imate, meaning that we keep the imate library,
# and create a symbolic link in glearn to point to the lib in imate.
#
# If either of imate or glearn has system lib, we keep the system lib, and we
# we create a symbolic link from the package that does not have system lib to
# the one that has system lib.
#
# If both packages have system libs, but they are two different openmp libs,
# then it raises an error. If they are the same, there is nothing to do.
#
# ================================================
# Alternative Method To Identify Libomp Dependency
# ================================================
#
# An alternative method to look into which libraries a python package has is
# by "threadpoolctl" package as follow:
#
# python -mpip install threadpoolctl
# python -m pip install imate
# python -m threadpoolctl -i imate

# Find System Libomp
# ==================

# compiled with it, which is usually an openmp that is installed on the system,
# such as the compiler's openmp. In this case, the libomp.dylib is not bundled
# (yet) to the package, rather, is available elsewhere. To find where this lib
# is, we search for all "*.so" files in the package, then apply "otool -L" on
# these files. This tool shows the libraries that each "so" file is linked
# with. We then grep the "omp.dylib" and get the path of libomp.dylib that is
# linked to at least one of the "*.so" files.

# copy the first lib to the second lib. This method has the advantage that if
# the python package corresponding to the first lib is uninstalled, the
# package corresponding to the second lib still can function. To do so, just
# comment the ln command below, and uncomment the rest of this function below.
