def load_omp():
    """
    A python interface to load omp.

    Why this is needed?

    On MacOS, a segmentation fault 11 error is returned when there are
    duplicate libomp libraries are loaded. In this package, there are two
    libomp libraries:

    1. In /glearn/_mean/linear_model.py, this module is being loaded
        
        from detkit import orthogonalize

    2. This package itself loads libomp when any of /glearn/_correlation/*.pyx
       is loaded.

    There are two ways to resolve this in /glearn/__init__.py.

    1. Import LinearModel after all glearn  modules, so that they choose the
       libomp that this package is compiled with.
    2. In /glearn/_mean/linear_model.py, do not import detkit at the top of the
       script, rather, import detkit whenever orthogonalize() is called.
    3. Create a dummy function to call libomp (the one that this package is
       compiled with), and call this function in the beginning of
       /glearn/__init__.py.

    The purpose of this function is the option (3) in the above.
