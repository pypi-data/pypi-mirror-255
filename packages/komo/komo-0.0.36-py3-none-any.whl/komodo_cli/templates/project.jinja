# Optional docker image. If not provided, the default Komodo image will be used, and if
# you have a requirements.txt in your project directory, those requirements will be installed
# into the image
# image: my-image:latest

# The directory inside the image where your command will run.
workdir: "/app"

# This is the directory that will be copied into your docker image workdir before running it.
# Specifying '.' as shown below will use the current project directory.
# This means that every time you run a job, all of the files you have in your project directory
# (doesn't matter if they're committed with git or not) will be copied into your docker image
# before starting the job.
workspace: .

# Set the environment variables you want to use here.
env:
  test_var: "test_value"

# These are optional mounts you can specify. Like docker mounts, you can specify mounts of type
# 'bind', 'volume', or 'device'. Since Komodo manages your cloud infrastructure for you, you
# generally will only need to set this for local backends. In other words, you probably only want
# to use this in the 'overrides' section in this config file, for a local backend.
# Each mount is an object with 3 keys: 'type', 'source', and 'target'. For example, a bind mount
# would look like:
#
# mounts:
#  - type: "bind"
#    source: "/my/source/directory"
#    target: "/my/target/directory"
mounts: []

# This is where you can override any of the above config items for specific backends.
# For example, you might want to add environment variables that only apply
# to a specific backend. You could do so like this:
#
# overrides:
#   my-backend:
#     env:
#       my_var: "some_value"
overrides:
{% for backend_name, backend_template in backends.items() %}
  {{ backend_name }}: {{ backend_template }}
{% endfor %}
