## Usage

### Importing Data

You just need to run the following command to download and import official data. Remember that you need to have a valid **TRADINGHOURS_TOKEN** environment variable.

```console
$ tradinghours import
Downloading..... (0.824s)
Ingesting.......................... (12.066s)
```

You can then check current data status with the following subcommand:

```console
$ tradinghours status --extended
Collecting timestamps.... (0.213s)
TradingHours Data Status:
  Remote Timestamp:   Thu Oct 26 02:08:17 2023
  Local Timestamp:    Thu Oct 26 03:12:40 2023

Reading local data.... (0.426s)
Extended Information:
  Currencies count:   30
  Markets count:      1012
```

### List Markets

```python
from tradinghours.market import Market
for market in Market.list_all()[:3]:
    print(market)
    
>>> Market: AE.ADX Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange Asia/Dubai
    Market: AE.DFM Dubai Financial Market Asia/Dubai
    Market: AE.DGCX Dubai Gold & Commodities Exchange Asia/Dubai
```

### Get Market

```python
from tradinghours.market import Market

# Get by either FinID or MIC
market = Market.get('US.NYSE')
market = Market.get('XNYS')
```

If a market is marked "permanently closed" it may be replaced or superseded by another market. 
By default, the newer market will be returned automatically. You can still retrieve the 
older market object for historical analysis by using the `follow=False` parameter.

```python
from tradinghours.market import Market

# AR.BCBA is permanently closed and replaced by AR.BYMA
market = Market.get('AR.BCBA')
original = Market.get('AR.BCBA', follow=False)

print(market.fin_id)
print(original.fin_id)

>>> AR.BYMA
    AR.BCBA
```

### Market Holidays

```python
from tradinghours.market import MarketHoliday

holidays = MarketHoliday.list_range('US.NYSE', "2024-01-01", "2024-12-31")
for holiday in holidays[:3]:
    print(holiday)

>>> MarketHoliday: US.NYSE 2024-01-01 New Year's Day
    MarketHoliday: US.NYSE 2024-01-15 Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr
    MarketHoliday: US.NYSE 2024-02-19 Washington's Birthday
```
### Trading Hours

```python
from tradinghours.market import Market

market = Market.get('XNYS')
for concrete_phase in list(market.generate_schedules("2023-09-01", "2023-09-30"))[:3]:
    print(concrete_phase)

>>> ConcretePhase: 2023-09-01 04:00:00-04:00 - 2023-09-01 09:30:00-04:00 Pre-Trading Session
    ConcretePhase: 2023-09-01 06:30:00-04:00 - 2023-09-01 09:30:00-04:00 Pre-Open
    ConcretePhase: 2023-09-01 09:30:00-04:00 - 2023-09-01 09:30:00-04:00 Call Auction
```

### List Currencies

```python
from tradinghours.currency import Currency

for currency in Currency.list_all()[:3]:
    print(currency)

>>> Currency: AUD Australian Dollar
    Currency: BRL Brazilian Real
    Currency: CAD Canadian Dollar
```

### Currency Holidays

```python
from tradinghours.currency import Currency

currency = Currency.get('AUD')
for holiday in currency.list_holidays("2023-06-01", "2023-12-31")[:3]:
    print(holiday)

>>> CurrencyHoliday: AUD 2023-06-12 King's Birthday
    CurrencyHoliday: AUD 2023-10-02 Labor Day
    CurrencyHoliday: AUD 2023-12-25 Christmas Day
```


### Change String Format
```python
from tradinghours.currency import Currency

Currency.set_string_format("{currency_code}: {financial_capital} - {financial_capital_timezone}")
currency = Currency.get("EUR")
print(currency)
>>> EUR: Frankfurt - Europe/Berlin

Currency.reset_string_format()
print(currency)
>>> Currency: EUR Euro
```
## Optional Advanced Configuration

By default, the library uses local file storage. Optionally you can 
configure the library to use an SQL store. You can adjust settings
using a **tradinghours.ini** file on the current working directory.

Here is a sample configuration file using file system storage:

```ini
[api]
token = YOUR-TOKEN-HERE

[data]
use_db = False
local_dir = /srv/tradinghours/local
remote_dir = /srv/tradinghours/remote
```

And here you can see one using a local SQL Alchemy database. Note that
you can use any valid [Database URL](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#database-urls):

```ini
[api]
token = YOUR-TOKEN-HERE

[data]
use_db = True
db_url = sqlite:///tradinghours.db
```

### Database Schema

In case you would like to directly access the tables for the SQL mode, you
can see that they all follow a very simple structure with keys for stored data
and the data with actual JSON. The library uses this simple structure that
should be compatible with nearly all database engines around.

Here is the DDL for the tables currently in use:

```sql
CREATE TABLE thstore_currencies (id INTEGER NOT NULL, slug VARCHAR, "key" VARCHAR, data JSON, PRIMARY KEY (id));
CREATE TABLE thstore_currency_holidays (id INTEGER NOT NULL, slug VARCHAR, "key" VARCHAR, data JSON, PRIMARY KEY (id));
CREATE TABLE thstore_holidays (id INTEGER NOT NULL, slug VARCHAR, "key" VARCHAR, data JSON, PRIMARY KEY (id));
CREATE TABLE thstore_markets (id INTEGER NOT NULL, slug VARCHAR, "key" VARCHAR, data JSON, PRIMARY KEY (id));
CREATE TABLE thstore_mic_mapping (id INTEGER NOT NULL, slug VARCHAR, "key" VARCHAR, data JSON, PRIMARY KEY (id));
CREATE TABLE thstore_schedules (id INTEGER NOT NULL, slug VARCHAR, "key" VARCHAR, data JSON, PRIMARY KEY (id));
CREATE TABLE thstore_season_definitions (id INTEGER NOT NULL, slug VARCHAR, "key" VARCHAR, data JSON, PRIMARY KEY (id));
```
