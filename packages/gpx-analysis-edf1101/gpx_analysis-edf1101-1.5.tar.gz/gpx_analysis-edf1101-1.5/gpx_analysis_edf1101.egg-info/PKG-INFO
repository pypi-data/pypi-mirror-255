Description: # Rowing-GPX-Analysis
        ## Introduction
        _GPX Analysis for rowing written in Python with a tkinter matplotlib interface_
        #### Why?
        I couldn't find the code for the old GPX analysis tool I wrote, so I'm taking the
        opportunity to build a better/ more robust one.
        
        ## Prerequisites
        #### Python Requirements
        - Python 3.11+
        - Numpy ```pip install numpy```
        - Matplotlib ```pip install matplotlib```
        - tkScrolledFrame ```pip install tkScrolledFrame```
        - Pillow (should already be installed with mpl) ```pip install pillow```
        
        _Given it downloads map images from online it requires an internet connection to run._
        
        ## Installation
        - For Standard users go to the GitHub page and download from releases
        - For Developers you can clone the repository, install the requirements and run as you wish.
        - It can also be installed with ```pip install gpx-analysis-edf1101``` and run from command line with ```python -m gpx_analysis``` 
        ## Getting Started & Notes
        - For instructions on how to use please view the [Getting started page](Getting_started.md) on the project's GitHub
        - On python due to tkinter bug workarounds it doesn't exit the application when you close the window, you will have to force quit it.
        
        ## Details
        The project is hosted online at https://github.com/edf1101/Rowing-GPX-Analysis
