Snok is a simple, modern, full-stack toolkit for Python.

Snok is in it's earliest stages, so feedback and ideas are very welcome and encouraged. Please open an [issue](https://github.com/anthonycorletti/snok/issues/new/choose) if you have a question, comment, feature request, idea, etc, and/or connect with Anthony directly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anthonycorletti) if you'd like to get in touch about the project.


## 🙋 Why?

The Python tooling ecosystem has plenty of options, and often times, it's not clear whether or not you're following the "right" way to do things, especially when those ways are changing week to week.

With this in mind, snok is a Python toolkit for developers that focuses on making it simple and easy to build modern, full-stack applications, across web and AI frameworks.

Snok leverages tools and packages from the Python ecosystem with awesome performance and developer experience to provide simple, effective, and easy to use workflows for developers.

Snok is designed for the programmer, and not much else.


## 🎉 Featuring

- Package generation
- Built-in dependency management
- Packaging with `setuptools`
- Linting and formatting with `ruff` and `black`
- Type checking with `mypy`
- Async, multi-worker testing with `pytest`
- Async API scaffolding with `fastapi`
- Async database integration with `pydantic`, `sqlmodel`, and `alembic`
- Natively deploy to [Modal](https://modal.com) and run key-value stores, jobs, and seamlessly access GPU compute.

## 🤩 Coming Soon

- AI framework integrations with `pytorch` and `langchain`
- Documentation site generation with `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-material`
- Connect to monitoring with services like `sentry` and `logz`, or with DIY `opentelemetry`
- Web-page generation with `tailwindcss` and `htmx`
