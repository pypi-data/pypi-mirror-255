# Getting Started with Open Weather One Call API

## Introduction

Get essential weather data, short-term and long-term forecasts and aggregated weather data is easy with our OpenWeather One Call API

## Install the Package

The package is compatible with Python versions `3 >=3.7, <= 3.11`.
Install the package from PyPi using the following pip command:

```python
pip install open-weather-one-call-sdk==1.0.1
```

You can also view the package at:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/open-weather-one-call-sdk/1.0.1

## Test the SDK

You can test the generated SDK and the server with test cases. `unittest` is used as the testing framework and `pytest` is used as the test runner. You can run the tests as follows:

Navigate to the root directory of the SDK and run the following commands

```
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
pytest
```

## Initialize the API Client

**_Note:_** Documentation for the client can be found [here.](https://www.github.com/SidneyAllen/open-weather-one-call-python-sdk/tree/1.0.1/doc/client.md)

The following parameters are configurable for the API Client:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `http_client_instance` | `HttpClient` | The Http Client passed from the sdk user for making requests |
| `override_http_client_configuration` | `bool` | The value which determines to override properties of the passed Http Client from the sdk user |
| `http_call_back` | `HttpCallBack` | The callback value that is invoked before and after an HTTP call is made to an endpoint |
| `timeout` | `float` | The value to use for connection timeout. <br> **Default: 60** |
| `max_retries` | `int` | The number of times to retry an endpoint call if it fails. <br> **Default: 0** |
| `backoff_factor` | `float` | A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try. <br> **Default: 2** |
| `retry_statuses` | `Array of int` | The http statuses on which retry is to be done. <br> **Default: [408, 413, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, 521, 522, 524]** |
| `retry_methods` | `Array of string` | The http methods on which retry is to be done. <br> **Default: ['GET', 'PUT']** |
| `appid` | `str` | API key to authorize requests. If you don't have an OpenWeatherMap API key, use `0e42a4c3dff34f7e42dbfcd804a5c917` |

The API client can be initialized as follows:

```python
from openweatheronecallapi.openweatheronecallapi_client import OpenweatheronecallapiClient
from openweatheronecallapi.configuration import Environment

client = OpenweatheronecallapiClient(
    appid='appid',
    environment=Environment.PRODUCTION
)
```

## Authorization

This API uses `Custom Query Parameter`.
