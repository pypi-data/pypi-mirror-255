Usage
=====

An installation of ``restoreio`` offers two interfaces: a Python interface and a command-line interface.

1. Python Interface
-------------------

You can import ``restoreio`` in python by ``import restoreio``. This package offers the following functions:

* `restoreio.restore <https://ameli.github.io/restoreio/generated/restoreio.restore.html#restoreio.restore>`__: This is the main function of the package which reconstructs incomplete velocity data, generates data ensemble, and performs statistical analysis. You can import this function by

  ::

    from restoreio import restore

* `restoreio.scan <https://ameli.github.io/restoreio/generated/restoreio.scan.html#restoreio.scan>`__: This function performs a pre-scan of your NetCDF dataset and ensures your dataset is compatible as an input to ``restoreio.restore`` function. The scan also provides you basic information about the dataset such as the time span, spatial extent of the data. These information could be useful to configure the settings for ``restoreio.restore`` function. You can import this function by

  ::

    from restoreio import scan

2. Command-Line Interface
-------------------------

Alternatively, you may use ``restoreio`` as a standalone application which can be executed in command line. When ``restoreio`` is installed, the following executables are available:

* `restore <https://ameli.github.io/restoreio/cli_restore.html>`__: This executable is equivalent to ``restoreio.restore`` function in the Python interface.
* `restore-scan <https://ameli.github.io/restoreio/cli_scan.html>`__: This executable is equivalent to ``restoreio.scan`` function in the Python interface.

To use these executables, make sure the ``/bin`` directory of your Python installation is set on your ``PATH`` environment variable. For instance, if your Python is installed on ``/opt/minicinda3/``, add this path ``/opt/miniconda3/bin`` directory to ``PATH`` by

::

    export PATH=/opt/minicinda/bin:$PATH

You may place the above line in ``~/.bashrc`` to make the above change permanently.

Online Web-Based Interface
==========================

Alongside ``restoreio`` python package, we also offer an online service as a web-based interface for this software. This platform is available at: `https://restoreio.org <https://restoreio.org>`__.

This online gateway allows users to efficiently process both local and remote datasets. The computational tasks are executed on the server side, leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of a high-performance computing cluster. Moreover, the web-based interface seamlessly integrates an interactive globe map, empowering sophisticated visualization of the results within the online platform.
