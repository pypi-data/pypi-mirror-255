# Qᴜᴀʟᴛʀᴀɴ

Qᴜᴀʟᴛʀᴀɴ (quantum algorithms translator) is a set of abstractions for representing quantum 
programs and a library of quantum algorithms expressed in that language to support quantum 
algorithms research.

**Note:** Qualtran is an experimental preview release. We provide no backwards compatibility 
guarantees. Some algorithms or library functionality may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies.
