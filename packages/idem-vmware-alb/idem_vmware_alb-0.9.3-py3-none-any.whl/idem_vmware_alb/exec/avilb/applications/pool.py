            This applies only when use_service_port is set to true. If enabled, SSL mode of the connection to the server is decided by the SSL mode on the Virtualservice service port, on which the request was received. Field introduced in 21.1.1. Allowed in Enterprise edition with any value, Enterprise with Cloud Services edition. Defaults to None.

        vrf_ref(str, Optional):
            Virtual Routing Context that the pool is bound to. This is used to provide the isolation of the set of networks the pool is attached to. The pool inherits the Virtual Routing Context of the Virtual Service, and this field is used only internally, and is set by pb-transform. It is a reference to an object of type VrfContext. Allowed in Enterprise edition with any value, Essentials, Basic, Enterprise with Cloud Services edition. Defaults to None.
