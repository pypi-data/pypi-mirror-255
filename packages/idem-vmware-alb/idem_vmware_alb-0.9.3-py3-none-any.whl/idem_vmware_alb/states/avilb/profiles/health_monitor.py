            profiles.health_monitor unique ID. Defaults to None.

        allow_duplicate_monitors(bool, Optional):
            By default, multiple instances of the same healthmonitor to the same server are suppressed intelligently. In rare cases, the monitor may have specific constructs that go beyond the server keys (ip, port, etc.) during which such suppression is not desired. Use this knob to allow duplicates. Field introduced in 18.2.8. Allowed in Enterprise edition with any value, Essentials edition(Allowed values- true), Basic edition(Allowed values- true), Enterprise with Cloud Services edition.

        disable_quickstart(bool, Optional):
            During addition of a server or healthmonitors or during bootup, Avi performs sequential health checks rather than waiting for send-interval to kick in, to mark the server up as soon as possible. This knob may be used to turn this feature off. Field introduced in 18.2.7. Allowed in Enterprise edition with any value, Essentials edition(Allowed values- false), Basic edition(Allowed values- false), Enterprise with Cloud Services edition. Defaults to None.
