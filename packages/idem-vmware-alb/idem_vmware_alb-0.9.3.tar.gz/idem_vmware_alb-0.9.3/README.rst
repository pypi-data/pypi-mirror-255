Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python 3.8+
* git *(if installing from source, or contributing to the project)*

Installation
------------

.. note::

   If wanting to contribute to the project, and setup your local development
   environment, see the ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` document in the source repository
   for this project.

You can install ``idem_vmware_alb`` either  from PyPI or from source.

Install from PyPI
+++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install "idem_vmware_alb"

Install from source
+++++++++++++++++++

Clone the ``idem_vmware_alb`` repository and install with pip.

.. code-block:: bash

   # clone repo
   git clone git@<your-project-path>/idem_vmware_alb.git
   cd idem_vmware_alb

   # Setup venv
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e idem_vmware_alb

Setup
=====

After installation avilb idem provider execution and state modules will be accessible to the pop `hub`.
In order to use them we need to set up our credentials.

Create a new file called `credentials.yaml` and populate it with profiles.
The `default` profile will be used automatically by `idem` unless you specify one with `--acct-profile=profile_name` on the cli.

credentials.yaml

..  code:: sls

    avilb:
      default:
        username: my_user
        password: my_good_password
        endpoint_url: https://console.avilb.com/api

Now encrypt the credentials file and add the encryption key and encrypted file path to the ENVIRONMENT.

.. code:: bash

    idem encrypt credentials.yaml

output::

    -A9ZkiCSOjWYG_lbGmmkVh4jKLFDyOFH4e4S1HNtNwI=

Add these to your environment:

.. code:: bash

    export ACCT_KEY="-A9ZkiCSOjWYG_lbGmmkVh4jKLFDyOFH4e4S1HNtNwI="
    export ACCT_FILE=$PWD/credentials.yaml.fernet

You are ready to use ``idem_vmware_alb``!

State Example
=============

Example of using avilb state in SLS:

my_state.sls:

.. code:: sls

    ensure_sample_exists:
      avilb.sample.present:
        - name: a_sample_name
        - description: Managed by Idem

Create sample state:

.. code:: bash

    idem state my_state.sls

Delete sample state:

.. code:: bash

    idem state my_state.sls --invert
