The ArangoDB-PyG Adapter exports Graphs from ArangoDB, the multi-model database for graph & beyond, into PyTorch Geometric (PyG), a PyTorch-based Graph Neural Network library, and vice-versa.

## About PyG

**PyG** *(PyTorch Geometric)* is a library built upon [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to easily write and train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for a wide range of applications related to structured data.

It consists of various methods for deep learning on graphs and other irregular structures, also known as *[geometric deep learning](http://geometricdeeplearning.com/)*, from a variety of published papers.
In addition, it consists of easy-to-use mini-batch loaders for operating on many small and single giant graphs, [multi GPU-support](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/tree/master/examples/multi_gpu), [`DataPipe` support](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/datapipe.py), distributed graph learning via [Quiver](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/tree/master/examples/quiver), a large number of common benchmark datasets (based on simple interfaces to create your own), the [GraphGym](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/graphgym.html) experiment manager, and helpful transforms, both for learning on arbitrary graphs as well as on 3D meshes or point clouds.

## Installation

#### Latest Release
```
pip install torch
pip install adbpyg-adapter
```
#### Current State
```
pip install torch
pip install git+https://github.com/arangoml/pyg-adapter.git
```

##  Quickstart

[![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/arangoml/pyg-adapter/blob/master/examples/ArangoDB_PyG_Adapter.ipynb)

Also available as an ArangoDB Lunch & Learn session on YouTube: [Graph & Beyond Course: ArangoDB-PyG Adapter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtGR95NN8bA)

```py
import torch
import pandas
from torch_geometric.datasets import FakeHeteroDataset

from arango import ArangoClient
from adbpyg_adapter import ADBPyG_Adapter, ADBPyG_Controller
from adbpyg_adapter.encoders import IdentityEncoder, CategoricalEncoder

# Connect to ArangoDB
db = ArangoClient().db()

# Instantiate the adapter
adbpyg_adapter = ADBPyG_Adapter(db)

# Create a PyG Heterogeneous Graph
data = FakeHeteroDataset(
    num_node_types=2,
    num_edge_types=3,
    avg_num_nodes=20,
    avg_num_channels=3,  # avg number of features per node
    edge_dim=2,  # number of features per edge
    num_classes=3,  # number of unique label values
)[0]
```

### PyG to ArangoDB

Note: If the PyG graph contains `_key`, `_v_key`, or `_e_key` properties for any node / edge types, the adapter will assume to persist those values as [ArangoDB document keys](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/data-modeling-naming-conventions-document-keys.html). See the `Full Cycle (ArangoDB -> PyG -> ArangoDB)` section below for an example.

# With `preserve_adb_keys=True`, the adapter will preserve the ArangoDB vertex & edge _key values into the (newly created) PyG graph.
# Users can then re-import their PyG graph into ArangoDB using the same _key values 
pyg_g = adbpyg_adapter.arangodb_graph_to_pyg("imdb", preserve_adb_keys=True)

# pyg_g["Movies"]["_key"] --> ["1", "2", ..., "1682"]
# pyg_g["Users"]["_key"] --> ["1", "2", ..., "943"]
# pyg_g[("Users", "Ratings", "Movies")]["_key"] --> ["2732620466", ..., "2730643624"]

# Let's add a new PyG User Node by updating the _key property
pyg_g["Users"]["_key"].append("new-user-here-944")

# Note: Prior to the re-import, we must manually set the number of nodes in the PyG graph, since the `arangodb_graph_to_pyg` API creates featureless node data
pyg_g["Movies"].num_nodes = len(pyg_g["Movies"]["_key"]) # 1682
pyg_g["Users"].num_nodes = len(pyg_g["Users"]["_key"]) # 944 (prev. 943)

# Re-import PyG graph into ArangoDB
adbpyg_adapter.pyg_to_arangodb("imdb", pyg_g, on_duplicate="update")
```

5. `pip install -e .[dev]`
6. (create an ArangoDB instance with method of choice)
7. `pytest --url <> --dbName <> --username <> --password <>`

**Note**: A `pytest` parameter can be omitted if the endpoint is using its default value:
```python
def pytest_addoption(parser):
    parser.addoption("--url", action="store", default="http://localhost:8529")
    parser.addoption("--dbName", action="store", default="_system")
