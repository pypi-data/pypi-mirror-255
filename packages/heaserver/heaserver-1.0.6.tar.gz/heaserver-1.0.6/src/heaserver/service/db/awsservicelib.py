"""
Functions for interacting with Amazon Web Services.

This module supports management of AWS accounts, S3 buckets, and objects in S3 buckets. It uses Amazon's boto3 library
behind the scenes.

In order for HEA to access AWS accounts, buckets, and objects, there must be a volume accessible to the user through
the volumes microservice with an AWSFileSystem for its file system. Additionally, credentials must either be stored
in the keychain microservice and associated with the volume through the volume's credential_id attribute,
or stored on the server's file system in a location searched by the AWS boto3 library. Users can only see the
accounts, buckets, and objects to which the provided AWS credentials allow access, and HEA may additionally restrict
the returned objects as documented in the functions below. The purpose of volumes in this case is to supply credentials
to AWS service calls. Support for boto3's built-in file system search for credentials is only provided for testing and
should not be used in a production setting. This module is designed to pass the current user's credentials to AWS3, not
to have application-wide credentials that everyone uses.

The request argument to these functions is expected to have a OIDC_CLAIM_sub header containing the user id for
permissions checking. No results will be returned if this header is not provided or is empty.

In general, there are two flavors of functions for getting accounts, buckets, and objects. The first expects the id
of a volume as described above. The second expects the id of an account, bucket, or bucket and object. The latter
attempts to match the request up to any volumes with an AWSFileSystem that the user has access to for the purpose of
determine what AWS credentials to use. They perform the
same except when the user has access to multiple such volumes, in which case supplying the volume id avoids a search
through the user's volumes.
