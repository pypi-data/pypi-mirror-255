    classification system.

    The AASHTO classification system is useful for classifying soils for highways. It
    categorizes soils for highways based on particle size analysis and plasticity
    characteristics. It classifies both coarse-grained and fine-grained soils into eight
    main groups (A1-A7) with subgroups, along with a separate category (A8) for organic
    soils.

    - ``A1 ~ A3`` (Granular Materials) :math:`\le` 35% pass No. 200 sieve
    - ``A4 ~ A7`` (Silt-clay Materials) :math:`\ge` 36% pass No. 200 sieve

    The Group Index ``(GI)`` is used to further evaluate soils with a group (subgroups).
    When calculating ``GI`` from the equation below, if any term in the parenthesis
    becomes negative, it is drop and not given a negative value. The maximum values of
    :math:`(F_{200} - 35)` and :math:`(F_{200} - 15)` are taken as 40 and :math:`(LL - 40)`
    and :math:`(PI - 10)` as 20.

    If the computed value for ``GI`` is negative, it is reported as zero.

    In general, the rating for the pavement subgrade is inversely proportional to the ``GI``
    (lower the ``GI``, better the material). For e.g., a ``GI`` of zero indicates a good
    subgrade, whereas a group index of 20 or greater shows a very poor subgrade.

    .. note::

        The ``GI`` must be mentioned even when it is zero, to indicate that the soil has been
        classified as per AASHTO system.

    The Unified Soil Classification System, initially developed by Casagrande in 1948 and

    is the most popular system for soil classification and is similar to Casagrande's
    Classification System. The system relies on particle size analysis and atterberg limits
    for classification.

    In this system, soils are first classified into two categories:

    - Coarse grained soils: If more than 50% of the soils is retained on No. 200 (0.075 mm)
      sieve, it is designated as coarse-grained soil.

    - Fine grained soils: If more than 50% of the soil passes through No. 200 sieve, it is
      designated as fine grained soil.

    Highly Organic soils are identified by visual inspection. These soils are termed as Peat.
