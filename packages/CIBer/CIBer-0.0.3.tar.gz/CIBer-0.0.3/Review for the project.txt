Folder CIBer is the package Folder, its name will be the name for command: import
e.g. import CIBer
     from CIBer import CIBer 
     (the former is the module name, the latter is the class name)

setup.py is the core of building package, containing all info and tools needed
setup(
    name: CIBer (which is the name used for pip, usually we set it to be the same with package folder name)
    packages: help tools locate which folder will be the package, find_pakcages will find all package, to indicate 
              it is a package folder, we need a __init__.py as indicator
)

MANIFEST.in will help to upload LICENSE and README.md 

all the above files are ready, we can upload by the following:

python -m build
(will build .tar and whl file)
twine check dist/*
(check whether all necessary files contained)

python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
(help to upload to testpypi)
twine upload dist/*
(help to upload to pypi)

here we use API to help upload, need an additional file .pypirc file
with form of:
[pypi](or [testpypi])
  username = __token__
  password = pypi-AgEIcHlwaS5vcmcCJDRmMzQyOThkLTllNDAtNDIwOC04NDM0LTQxYjczZmI0NjAyZgACKlszLCI2NDY4ODM5Ni1kMGViLTRjZDAtYmQ3NC1iYTY0NTVlZGQ3ZWEiXQAABiBv_fp7lHjb6Bff2EdC1nhWXeiq2MHs3ipCHMtTHpGAYA
the file should be located in C:\Users\sunset1456

password is the token value from pypi
we can create token in account setting by creating a new project


in code part, if we want to include function of another .py (which is a module of the package also) e.g.
can be import by CIBer.CIBer_Engineering in the final package
but during the establishing, we need to use .CIBer_Engineering, '.' indicating we may find it in the same folder
