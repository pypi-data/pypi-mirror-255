        image: input image, can be grayscale or multiple channels.
        softmask: softmask in range [0, 1] with seed information.
        spacing: spacing for 3D data
        v: weighting factor for establishing relationship between unary and spatial distances.
        lamb: weighting factor between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 returns euclidean distance, whereas 1.0 returns geodesic distance
        iter: number of passes of the iterative distance transform method
