# Subprocess Mock

_Mock objects for the standard libraryâ€™s subprocess module_

```
pip install subprocess-mock
```

Installation in a virtual environment is recommended.


## Example Usage

Use the functions defined in the **subprocess\_mock.functions** module
(and also exposed in the **subprocess_mock** namespace) to patch
subprocess module functions in unit tests in order to record the calls.


```python
>>> import pathlib
>>> import subprocess
>>> import subprocess_mock
>>> from unittest.mock import patch
>>>
>>> new_file = pathlib.Path("testfile.txt")
>>> new_file.exists()
False
>>> # Test: call a process with a mock.patched subprocess.run
>>> # The process not called with normal effects,
>>> # but a call is recorded in the subprocess_mock.functions module
>>> # (convenience modules for accessing the _CALL_RESULTS list
>>> # will be added in a later release)
>>>
>>> all_results = subprocess_mock.functions._CALL_RESULTS
>>> with patch("subprocess.run", new=subprocess_mock.run):
...     run_result = subprocess.run(["touch", str(new_file)])
...
>>> run_result
CompletedProcess(args=['touch', 'testfile.txt'], returncode=0)
>>> all_results
[(CompletedProcess(args=['touch', 'testfile.txt'], returncode=0), {})]
>>> new_file.exists()
False
>>>
>>> # Counter-test: call the process without patching subprocess.run
>>> # The process is called with normal effects, no call is recorded
>>>
>>> all_results.clear()
>>> all_results
[]
>>> run_result = subprocess.run(["touch", str(new_file)])
>>> new_file.exists()
True
>>> all_results
[]
>>>
```
