class UpdateCommand:
    """
    Executes the 'update' command to update the local nimble package. This command performs a series of operations to ensure that the user's local nimble installation is updated to the latest version from the master branch of its GitHub repository. It primarily involves pulling the latest changes from the repository and reinstalling the package.

    Usage:
    Upon invocation, the command first checks the user's configuration for the 'no_predict' setting. If 'no_predict' is set to True, or if the user explicitly confirms with 'Y' when asked, the command proceeds to update the local nimble package. It changes the current directory to the nimble package directory, checks out the master branch of the nimble repository, pulls the latest changes, and then reinstalls the package using pip.

    The command structure is as follows:
    1. Change directory to the nimble package directory.
    2. Check out the master branch of the nimble GitHub repository.
    3. Pull the latest changes with the '--ff-only' option to ensure a fast-forward update.
    4. Reinstall the nimble package using pip.

    Example usage:
    >>> nimcli legacy update

    Note:
    This command is intended to be used within the nimble CLI to facilitate easy updates of the nimble package. It should be used with caution as it directly affects the local installation of the package. It is recommended to ensure that any important data or configurations are backed up before running this command.
