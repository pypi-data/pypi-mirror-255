# Giza CLI

Welcome to Giza CLI!

This CLI provides the utilities to interact with Giza using the terminal.

## 🤔 What capabilities does the CLI offer?

The CLI will serve as the main entrypoint for Giza Platform for developers. It aims to provide a tool to ease the managing of resources that exists in Giza Platform.

For now it provides the following capabilities:

* User related utilities, like `create`, `login` (JWT Authentication) and `create_api_key` (API Key Authentication)
* Model transpilation with `transpile` using multiple frameworks, like Cairo or EZKL
* Model versioning
* Proof generation for multiple frameworks, like Orion Cairo or EZKL
* Deployment of models to the Giza Platform for verifiable inferences
* Workspace management to help you with Giza Actions
* Actions jumpstart with `new` command to help you get started with your actions

In the future each new resource added to Giza will have its corresponding capability in the CLI.
