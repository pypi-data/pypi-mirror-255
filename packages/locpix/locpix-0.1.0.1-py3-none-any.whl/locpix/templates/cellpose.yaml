# "Model is trained on two-channel images, where the first channel is the channel to segment,
# and the second channel is an optional nuclear channel."
# Options for each:
#   a. 0=grayscale, 1=red, 2=green, 3=blue
#   b. 0=None (will set to zero), 1=red, 2=green, 3=blue
# e.g. channels = [0,0] if you want to segment cells in grayscale
