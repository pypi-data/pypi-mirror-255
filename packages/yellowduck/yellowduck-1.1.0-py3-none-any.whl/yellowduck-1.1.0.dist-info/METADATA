## What is it?

**yellowduck** is the data science toolbox for everyone. To be precise, for the lazy man like me!

Actually, **yellowduck** is like a sandbox library for me. If I found something great I will surely add it in **yellowduck**. 

## Main Features

- Image grouping by its similarity
- Text grouping by its similarity
- Text cleansing function

## Example

Please go to this [Link](https://github.com/PCP55/yellowduck-dev/tree/main/examples)


## Install

You have to specify functions you want to use:
If you need full option of `yellowduck`, you can install it by using:

```ruby
# PyPI

pip install "yellowduck[full]==x.x.x"
```

However, if you need to use only text's functions or image's function, you will need:

```ruby
# PyPI

pip install "yellowduck[text]==x.x.x"

# or

pip install "yellowduck[image]==x.x.x"

# accordingly
```

## Found Issues

Create New Issue [here](https://github.com/PCP55/yellowduck-dev/issues) and I will fix it as soon as I have a free time. (LOL)
