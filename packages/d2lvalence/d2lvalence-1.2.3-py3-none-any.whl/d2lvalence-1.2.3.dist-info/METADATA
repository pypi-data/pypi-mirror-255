====================
This is a Re-Release
====================
This is a re-release of the ``d2lvalence`` Python package originally released by
Viktor Haag and the D2L Extensibility product development team. This re-release
is version 1.2.2, released by that team in 2016. Although this was originally only
tested up to Python 3.5, our team has tested this with Python releases up to
3.10.13 without issue.

Desire2Learn Client Library for Python
======================================
The Python library divides functionality into a number of modules. The primary
module helps with authentication. Several supporting modules can assist with
making calls in several areas of the Valence API.

**Authentication**. The `d2lvalence.auth` module provides assistance for
the authentication needed to invoke Valence APIs. You use the module's functions
(and perhaps also classes) to create a
`calling user context <d2lvalence.auth.D2LUserContext>` object that
you can then employ in conjunction with the Requests package as an
authentication helper.


Installation
============
You can find the source for our Python client library SDK in two locations:

* Our own `Python client GitHub repository <https://github.com/Desire2Learn-Valence/valence-sdk-python>`_. 

* On the PyPi `package index repository <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/D2LValence>`_,
  so you can install it as a package with pip or easy_install.

**Dependencies**. In order to use the Python client library SDK, you'll need to
first ensure you have a working Python development environment:

* Python 3 (the reference environment uses Python 3.5), or Python 2.7 (via the
  use of the future library).

* The `Requests Python package <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html>`_
  gets included in our `auth <d2lvalence.auth>` module so that you can use a
  calling user context object as an authentication helper for Requests.

* The `python-future <http://python-future.org/index.html>`_ library gets used
  to provide Python 2.7 compatibility.

* The `Bottle Python package <http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/>`_ if you want to
  use the samples available in conjunction with this client library (not a
  dependency for the client library itself).
