The Neural Networks and Graphs' Topology (NNGT) module provides tools to
generate and study graphs and detailed biological networks.
It also lets user interface efficient graph libraries with highly distributed
activity simulators to make the study of neuronal activity as easy and
efficient as possible.

Source code is available and contributions are accepted on
[SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~tfardet/NNGT) (preferred),
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/tfardet/NNGT), and
[GitHub](https://github.com/tfardet/NNGT).

For questions or issues, please check the
[mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~tfardet/nngt-users) and the
[issue tracker](https://codeberg.org/tfardet/NNGT/issues).


## Principle

NNGT provides a unified interface that acts as a wrapper for 3 major graph
libraries in Python: [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/),
[igraph](https://igraph.org/python/), and
[graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/).

Use the same code, run it at home on the latest linux with graph-tool, then
on your collaborator's laptop with networkx on Windows, no changes required!

In addition to this common interface, NNGT provides additional tools and
methods to generate complex neuronal networks.
Once the networks are created, they can be seamlessly sent to the
[nest-simulator](https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/), which will generate
activity. This activity can then be analyzed together with the structure using
NNGT.

Eventually, NNGT is also able to import neuronal networks generated using the
[DeNSE](https://dense.readthedocs.io/) simulator for neuronal growth.


## Install and use the library

NNGT requires Python 3.5+ since version 2.0, and is directly available on Pypi.
To install it, make sure you have a valid Python installation, then do:

```
pip install nngt
```

If you want to use it with advanced geometry, geospatial or other tools, you
can use the various extra to automatically download the relevant dependencies
keep only one of the listed possibilities)

```
pip install nngt[matplotlib|nx|ig|geometry|geospatial]
```

To install all dependencies, use `pip install nngt[full]`.

To use it, once installed, open a Python terminal or script file and type

```python
import nngt
```

If you want to have the latest updates before they are released into a stable
version, you can install directly from ``main`` via:

```
pip install --user git+https://git.sr.ht/~tfardet/NNGT@main
```


## Support and bug reports

For general questions or support, you can write the
[mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~tfardet/nngt-users).

If you stumble on bugs you can report them on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/tfardet/NNGT/issues).


## Cloning/updating the repository

This repository includes the
[``PyNCultures``](https://github.com/SENeC-Initiative/PyNCulture) package from
the [SENeC](https://github.com/SENeC-Initiative/) initiative as its
``geometry`` module, using the
[``git submodule``](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
feature.
It also uses
[``mpl_chord_diagram``](https://codeberg.org/tfardet/mpl_chord_diagram) whithin
the plot module.
Thus, when cloning the repository, you must do:

    git clone https://git.sr.ht/~tfardet/NNGT
    cd NNGT && git submodule init && git submodule update

To update your local repository, do:

    git pull
    git submodule update --remote --merge


## Features

  [DeNSE](https://dense.readthedocs.io/).

**Status**
* Standard functions and graph generation algorithms.
* Special methods for graph analysis on weighted directed networks.
* Full support for node and edge attributes.
* Extended I/O features as well as graphical representations.
* Advanced methods to design neuronal networks.
