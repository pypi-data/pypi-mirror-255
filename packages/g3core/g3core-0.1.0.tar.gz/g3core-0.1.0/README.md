# System G3 Core Parser

Parser of the G3 Core library.


## Overview

- Easy file data access.
- Reading library files from a local directory or directly from a git repo.
- Value formatting is quite primitive, data validation (types mismatch, overflows, etc.) is not implemented at the moment.


## Installation

```python
pip install g3core
```
