    Note
    ----
    Python 3.11 allows dispatching on Union types and
    this should greatly simplify the code.

    Arguments
    ---------
    model:
        An instance of `Transformer` that represents a model from the
        `transformers` library.
    max_tokens:
        The maximum number of tokens to generate.
    stop_at:
        Text sequences such that the generation stops after they've been
        generated.
    sampler:
        The sampling algorithm to use to generate token ids from the logits
        distribution.

    Returns
    -------
    A `SequenceGenerator` instance that generates text.
