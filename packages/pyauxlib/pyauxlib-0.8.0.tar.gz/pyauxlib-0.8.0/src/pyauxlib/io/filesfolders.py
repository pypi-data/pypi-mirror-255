        The relative path of the file with respect to a parent directory.

    ----------

        The Path object to search for files.
    file_extensions : list[str], optional

    This function iterates through a folder and its subfolders (if `subfolders` is True),

    it yields the file itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    folder : str | Path
        The parent folder to start the search.
    file_extensions : list[str], optional
        List of file extensions to filter by. If None (default), all files are yielded.
    file_patterns : list[str], optional
        List of patterns that the file names should match. If None (default), all files are yielded.
        If multiple patterns are provided, a file is returned if its name matches any pattern.
        Patterns can include wildcards like '*' and '?', to match multiple
        characters or a single character, respectively. For example:
            - ["*before*"]: matches all files that have the word "before" in their name.
            - ["*.txt"]: matches all files with the '.txt' extension.
            - ["file_?.txt"]: matches all files with names like 'file_1.txt', 'file_2.txt', etc.
            - ["file_[0-9].txt"]: equivalent to the previous example, but uses a character set
              to match any digit between 0 and 9.
    exclude_patterns : bool, optional
        If True, returns files that do not match `file_patterns`.
    subfolders : bool, optional
        If True (default), includes subfolders in the search.
    parent_path : Path, optional
        The path of the parent, used to return the relative paths to reconstruct the folder
        hierarchy

    Yields
    ------
    FileRelPath
