        is the appropriate titlecasing of that play's name in English, with the word "of" not titlecased.
        In German, however, the title is "Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor," and both "lustigen" and "von"
        are not titlecased.  In French even fewer words are titlecased: "Les joyeuses commeres de Windsor."

        influence which letter or letters of a "word" are uppercased when titlecasing strings.  For example

    and the era begins on the day an emperor ascends the throne and continues until his death.
    The era changes at 12:00AM.
    
    For example, the current era is Reiwa. It started on 2019/5/1 A.D.  Therefore, Gregorian year 2019 is also Reiwa 1st.
    2019/5/1 A.D. is also Reiwa 1st 5/1.
    
    Any date in the year during which era is changed can be reckoned in either era. For example,
    2019/1/1 can be 1/1 Reiwa 1st year or 1/1 Heisei 31st year.
