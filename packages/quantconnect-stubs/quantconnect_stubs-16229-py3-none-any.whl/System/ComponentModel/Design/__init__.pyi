    the help keyword for a class is the Type's full name, and for a member it's the full name of the type that declared the property,
    plus the property name itself.
    
    For example, consider System.Windows.Forms.Button and it's Text property:
    
    The class keyword is "System.Windows.Forms.Button", but the Text property keyword is "System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text", because the Text
    property is declared on the System.Windows.Forms.Control class rather than the Button class itself; the Button class inherits the property.
    By contrast, the DialogResult property is declared on the Button so its keyword would be "System.Windows.Forms.Button.DialogResult".
    
    When the help system gets the keywords, it will first look at this attribute. At the class level, it will return the string specified by the
    HelpContextAttribute. Note this will not be used for members of the Type in question. They will still reflect the declaring Type's actual
    full name, plus the member name. To override this, place the attribute on the member itself.
    
    Example:
    
    [HelpKeywordAttribute(typeof(Component))]
    public class MyComponent : Component {
    
    
    public string Property1 { get{return "";};
