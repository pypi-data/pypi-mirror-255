# supervised-discretization

This repository contains the code for the paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2023.11.019">Supervised Feature Compression based on Counterfactual Analysis</a>

## Installation

* The MILP problem for computing the Counterfactual Explanation for a point is implemented in <a href="https://www.gurobi.com/solutions/gurobi-optimizer/?campaignid=18262689303&adgroupid=138243449982&creative=620260718865&keyword=gurobi&matchtype=e&gclid=Cj0KCQiA4OybBhCzARIsAIcfn9mYA1eyslmYMVKkmSzUWuZeLKwpNXdPrcIoKLnEr60zcnHFDSpc5j8aAgzgEALw_wcB">Gurobi</a>.
An active Gurobi Licence is needed to run the code.

* The package can be installed with the command:
```
pip install SupervisedDiscretization
```

## Hyperparameters
The implementation of the FCCA procedure can be found in the file *discretize.py* that contains the Python class *FCCA* which takes the following parameters:
* **estimator**: an unfitted binary classifier from the <a href='https://scikit-learn.org/stable/'>sklearn</a> package. It can be one of the following: RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoosting, LinearSVC, SVC(kernel='linear'). It is also possible to take in input GridSearchCV to choose in cross validation the parameters of the estimator;
* **p0**, **p1**: lower and upper bound for the classification probability of points for which computing the Counterfactual Explanation; 
* **lambda0**, **lambda1**, **lambda2**: hyperparameters for the Counterfactual Explanation problem that represents respectively the weights for the l0-, l1- and l2- norm;
* **compress**: boolean that is set to True to merge thresholds whose absolute difference is smaller than 0.01;
* **timelimit**: time limit in seconds for solving the Counterfactual Explanations problem;
* **verbose**: boolean that is set to True to print some informations about the process of fitting the FCCA procedure.

The FCCA class offers the following methods:
* **fit**: method for fitting the FCCA procedure;
* **transform**: method for discretizing a dataset by using the set of thresholds previously computed via the **fit** method;
* **fit_transform**: method for applying in sequence the **fit** and **transform** methods;
* **selectThresholds**: method for setting a different value of Q after the **fit** has been called; this method allows to subsample the set of thresholds in a fast way without recomputing the FCCA procedure.

## Execution
We report an example on how to use the FCCA procedure on new data. The example can also be found in the file *example.py*
