[![Upload Python Package](https://github.com/wmo-raf/cap-editor/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wmo-raf/cap-editor/actions/workflows/publish.yml)

A Wagtail Commmon Alerting Protocol (CAP) Editor python package installable as an app on any wagtail project (
version\>=4.1).

The **Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)** provides an open, non-proprietary digital message format for all types of alerts
and notifications. It does not address any particular application or telecommunications method. The CAP format is
compatible with emerging techniques, such as Web services, as well as existing formats including the Specific Area
Message Encoding (SAME) used for the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio
and the Emergency Alert System (EAS)

The CAP xml response follows the structure of the schema provided at
http://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.html

    - Draw a polygon
    - Draw a circle
    - Use Geocode key values
- Inbuilt publishing workflow using Wagtail's powerful page model, with automated emails to composers and approvers
- Collaborate with team members using inbuilt comments (similar to how you could do in Word) with automated

- It is all open-source ðŸ¥³!

## Quick start

#### 1. Install in virualenvironment using pip

``` sh
pip install capeditor
```

#### 2. Configure settings

In your `settings.py` or `settings/base.py`, within the installed apps, include the `rest_framework, rest_framework_xml`
and `capeditor` as below:

``` py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework_xml',
    'capeditor'
]
```

Set up restframeworkxml renderers

``` py
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',
        'rest_framework_xml.renderers.XMLRenderer',  # add XMLRenderer
    ),
    'DEFAULT_PARSER_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework_xml.parsers.XMLParser',
    ),
}
```

#### 3. Run model migrations

``` sh
python manage.py migrate
```

## Usage

### Creating a CAP Alert

With capeditor successfully installed, both the Alert Listing page and Alert Detail page will be available on wagtail
admin interface.

    - AlertList
       |_ Alert 1
       |_ Alert 2

Create an `Alert Listing Page` by adding it as a child page and specifying the title of the page. This page will host a
list of all alerts created.

![Alert List Page](images/alert_list.png "Alert List Page")

Create one or more `Alert Page` by adding it as a child to the
`Alert Listing Page`

![Alert Detail Page](images/alert_detail.png "Alert Detail Page")

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Sections in the Alert Page and corresponding XML

The overall Document Object Model of an alert is as below:

![Alert DOM](images/alert_sections/dom.jpg "CAP Document Object Model")

#### A. Alert Identification

This is the root section of CAP corresponds to:

``` xml
<alert>
    <!-- ... -->
</alert>
```

It contains the **Message ID (identifier), Sender ID(sender), Sent Dat/Time (sent), Message Status (status), Message
Type (msgType), Scope
(scope), Restriction (restriction), Addresses (addresses), Note (note), Reference IDs (references) and Incident ids (
incidents)**.

***NOTE:*** Some fields are visible based on selection of different parameters.

![Alert Identification](images/alert_sections/alert_id.png "Alert Identification section")

#### B. Alert Info

This is an optional child section of the Alert Identification Section i.e

``` xml
<alert>
    <!-- ... -->
    <info></info>
    <info></info>
</alert>
```

Multiple instances of this section are allowed. It contains the
**Langauge (langauge), Event Category/Categories (category), Event Type

        <area></area>
        <area></area>
    </info>
    <info>
        <area></area>
    </info>
</alert>
```

``` xml
<alert>
    <!-- ... -->
    <info>
        <resource><resource>
        <resource><resource>
        <area></area>
        <area></area>

Multiple instances of this section are allowed. It contains the
**Description (resourceDesc), MIME Type (mimeType), File Size (size), URI (uri), Dereferenced URI (derefUri) and
Digest (digest)**

## Integrations

To integrate the alerts to another wagtail page and include in templates, for example in the home page refer to sandbox
folder for sample standalone.

# MQTT Integration

You can publish a mqtt message immediately after a CAP alert has been published. This allows connected clients to
receive the CAP message using the MQTT protocol.

You will need to setup a MQTT broker. We have included the docker configuration to setup a local broker instance
using [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)

You need to add a `CAP_BROKER_URI` setting to your `settings.py` which should be the URI to a MQTT broker with
permissions to publish messages.

Then using [Wagtail page_published signal](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/signals.html#page-published)
or [Wagtail after_publish_page hook](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/hooks.html#after-publish-page), you
can attach a function to publish the MQTT message.

Below is a sample snippet to achieve this in your `models.py`

```python
# models.py
from wagtail.signals import page_published

from capeditor.models import AbstractCapAlertPage
from capeditor.pubsub.publish import publish_cap_mqtt_message


class CapAlertPage(AbstractCapAlertPage):
    ....


def on_publish_cap_alert(sender, **kwargs):
    instance = kwargs['instance']

    topic = "cap/alerts/all"

    publish_cap_mqtt_message(instance, topic)


page_published.connect(on_publish_cap_alert, sender=CapAlertPage)
```

Using the sample above, once a CAP Alert Page has published, a corresponding `mqtt message` will also be published
immediately.

You will need to decide how to structure your MQTT alert topics.

You can have a complete look at the code under `sandbox/home/models.py`
