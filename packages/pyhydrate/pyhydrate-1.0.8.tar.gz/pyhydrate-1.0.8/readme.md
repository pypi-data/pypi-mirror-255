Easily access your json, yaml, dicts, and/or list with dot notation.

`PyHydrate` is a JFDI approach to interrogating common data structures without worrying about `.get()`
methods, defaults, or array slicing.  It is easy to use and errors are handled gracefully when trying 
to drill to data elements that may not exist.  Additionally, data types are inferred, recursive depths 
are tracked, and key casting to snake case is mapped and managed.

### Installation
Install using `pip`
```bash
pip install pyhydrate
# or, if you would like to upgrade the library
pip install -U pyhydrate
```

### A Simple Example
Load any Python variable, and the class hydration will
ensue.  Access the data via dot notation.
```python
from pyhydrate import PyHydrate as PyHy

_doc = {
  "level-one": {
    "levelTWO": {
      "Level3": {
        "TestString": "test string",
        "testInteger": 1,
        "test_Float": 2.345,
        "Test_BOOL": True
      }
    }
  }
}

_demo = PyHy(_doc, debug=True)

print(_demo.level_one.level_two)

# debug output
# >>> Root :: <PyHydrate>
#   >>> Object :: Get == level_one :: Depth == 1
#      >>> Object :: Get == level_two :: Depth == 2

# print output (yaml)
# level_3:
#   test_string: test string
#   test_integer: 1
#   test_float: 2.345
#   test_bool: true
```

Then access any level of the hydration by making a call to the class. 
Valid values are: <empty >, 'value', 'element', 'type', 'depth', 'map',
'json', and 'yaml'.  See nomenclature below.

```python
print(_demo.level_one.level_two('element'))

# debug output
# >>> Root :: <PyHydrate>
#    >>> Object :: Get == level_one :: Depth == 1
#       >>> Object :: Get == level_two :: Depth == 2
#          >>> Object :: Call == element :: Depth == 3

# print output (dict)
# {'dict': {'level_3': {'test_string': 'test string', 'test_integer': 1, 'test_float': 2.345, 'test_bool': True}}}
```

If a data point does not exist via expressed notation, an unknown/None/null 
value is returned.

```python
print(_demo.level_one.level_four)

# debug output
# >>> Root :: <PyHydrate>
#    >>> Object :: Get == level_one :: Depth == 1
#       >>> Object :: Get == level_four :: Depth == 2
#          >>> Primitive :: Call == value :: Depth == 3 :: Output == None

# print output (yaml)
# NoneType: null
```

### Nomenclature
The following nomenclature is being used within the code base, within
the documentation, and within

- Structure: A complex data element expressed as a dict or list, and any 
  combination of nesting between the two.
  - Object: A collection of key/value pairs, expressed as a dict in the 
    code base.
  - Array:  A collection of primitives, Objects, or other Arrays, expressed
    as a list in the code base.
- Primitive: A simple atomic piece of data with access to its type and 
  underlying value.
  - String:  A quoted collection of UTF-8 characters.
  - Integer: A signed integer.
  - Float: A variable length decimal number.
  - None: A unknown Primitive, expressed as `None` with a `NoneType` type.
- Values: A primary data element in the code base used to track the lineage
  of the transformations in the class.
  - Source: The raw provided document, either a Structure or a Primitive.
  - Cleaned: Similar value to the source, but with the keys in the Objects
    cleaned to be cast as lower case snake.
  - Hydrated: A collection of nested classes representing Structures and
    Primitives that allows the dot notation access and graceful failures.
- Element: A single dict output representation, where the key is represented 
  as the type and the value is the Structure
- Type: The Python expression of `type` with respect to the data being 
  interrogated.
- Map: A dict representation of the translations from source Object keys
  to "cleaned" keys, i.e. the Cleaned Values.
